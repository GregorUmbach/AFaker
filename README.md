## Idea
You know those moments, where you need to make small changes, download something
or look something up but you have to be registered on that website to do so?
If so, I am sure you also know how annoying it can be to fill those forms and
especially when are going to make a fake account.

### Why would you want to create a fake account?
Of course, because of privacy issues. You don't want to be the product. In many
cases it is not even worth to give your personal data away, because of the short
usage of their services or similar.

### Is it even worth to use a program for creating fake accounts?
This depends pretty much on how many fake accounts you create generally and of
course how lazy you are :).

### Is it worth to write a program for creating fake accounts?
I don't know. I don't care. But I hope this will get usable and will save some
people out there some time!

### NOTICE
* This project is primarily to see where I can get this to.
* It is possible that this project won't ever be runnable at all. I already can
think of many big problems I will face, even before writing a single line of code.
* My C++ skills are pretty low.
** This project also servers as a practice playground for me. So if you see
anything that I could do better, __don't hesitate__ and tell me please.
